# ðŸ§  Breast-cancer-prediction-nn-pytorch
A deep learning project for breast cancer detection using PyTorch. It performs exploratory data analysis to understand patterns and distributions, followed by preprocessing and feature scaling. A neural network is then trained (with GPU support) to predict diagnoses from clinical data.
